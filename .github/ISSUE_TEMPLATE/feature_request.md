IDEA Name: COMMISSION
Tracking commission is an important part of many businesses. 
Commission settings can be specified at a global level, employee level, and even the item level.
Item level commissions take precedent over Employee level commissions. Employee level commission settings take precedent over Global level commissions.
Note: Commission can be based on the selling price or profit of an item.

SETTING UP COMMISSION
The first step in setting up commission is deciding how it applies to your business.

GLOBAL LEVEL
If everyone has the same commissions you just need to setup at the global level. 
"Commission Default Rate (Percent Commission Is Based On The Selling Price Or Profit Of An Item)"
"Commission Percent Calculation Method:" (selling price or profit)
Once this is set up, all employees will receive commission based on these settings.
 
EMPLOYEE LEVEL
If your business has different commissions per employee; you can set these same.

ITEM LEVEL
And finally, if you have particular items/item kits that have no commission or different values you can set these values on the item level. NOTE: item level commissions apply to everyone at the same value.

Also, you have to take into your consideration the reports to show commissions.
