**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
My future is not related to any problem, it is totally new idea.

Name for the Feature request: CURRENCY EXCHANGE
Easily Accept any Currency Denomination While making a Sale or Return.

SETUP
To implement this future, you can use NexoPOS Setting to set up Multiple Currency with exchange rates. Or you can use Inventory, Add a New Item, Price to set up Multiple Currency with exchange rates. I prefer the first option. 

At the checkout, Completing sale with Exchange Rate
Simply select the payment currency from the dropdown when completing the sale
